A colour painter / etch a sketch. Based on an Odin Project exercise. I've learned to generate divs with JS, how to style them to create a grid and I have expanded my DOM manipulation knowledge.

Possible features to add: 
- Rainbow effect: every time the cursor moves over a square, the background color for the square cycles through 10 possible colors (either random or linear)
- Hue effect: every time the cursor moves over same square, change hue of this square (10 hues) 
- Let user choose initial background color / mouseover color
